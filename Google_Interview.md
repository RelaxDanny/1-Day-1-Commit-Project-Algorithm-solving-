# The Google Interview

There are many scary rumors floating around about Google interviews, but they're mostly just that: rumors.

The interview is not terribly different from Microsoft's or Amazon's,

A Google engineer performs the first phone screen, so expect tough technical questions. These questions

may involve coding, sometimes via a shared document. Candidates are typically held to the same standard

and are asked similar questions on phone screens as in on-site interviews.

# On your on-site interview, 

you'll interview with four to six people, one of whom will be a lunch interviewer.

Interviewer feedback is kept confidential from the other interviewers, so you can be assured that you enter

each interview with blank slate. Your lunch interviewer doesn't submit feedback, so this is a great opportunity 

to ask honest questions.

Interviewers are typically not given specific focuses, and there is no "structure" or "system" as to what you're

asked when. Each interviewer can conduct the interview however she would like.

# Written feedback 

is submitted to a hiring committee (HC) of engineers and managers to make a hire and no-hire recommendation. 

Feedback is typically broken down into four categories (Analytical Ability, Coding,

Experience, and Communication) and you are given an overall score from 1.0 to 4.0.The HC usually does not

include any of your interviewers. If it does, it was purely by random chance.

To extend an offer, the HC wants to see at least one interviewer who is an "enthusiastic endorser," In other

words, a packet with scores of 3.6,3.1,3,1 and 2.6 is better than all 3,1s.

You do not necessarily need to excel in every interview, and your phone screen performance is usually not

a strong factor in the final decision.

If the hiring committee recommends an offer, your packet will go to a compensation committee and then

to the executive management committee. Returning a decision can take several weeks because there are

so many stages and committees.

# Definitely Prepare:

As a web-based company, Google cares about how to design a scalable system. So, make sure you prepare

for questions from System Design and Scalability.

Google puts a strong focus on analytical (algorithm) skills, regardless of experience. You should be very well

prepared for these questions, even if you think your prior experience should count for more.

# What's Different:

Your interviewers do not make the hiring decision. Rather, they enter feedback which is passed to a hiring

committee. The hiring committee recommends a decision which can be—though rarely is—rejected by Google executives
